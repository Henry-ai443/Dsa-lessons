## Lesson 3: Time vs Space Complexity

###Time Complexity
Measures how long an algorithm takes to run as input grows.We count steps.

###Space complexity
Measures how much memory is needed as input grows. We count variables, arrays and stack space.

### Trade-offs
Sometimes, we use more space to make things faster(like with caching or lookup tebles).
