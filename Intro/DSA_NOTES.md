##  What are Data Structures ?

Data structures are ways to organize and store data in memory to use it efficiently.

## EXAMPLES:

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

## What are Algorithms?

Algorithms are  a series of steps to solve a specific problem using data and logic.

## EXAMPLES:
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick)
- Traversing structres
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
