## Lesson 4: Arrays

### What is an Array?
An array is a collection of items stored at contagious memory locations. It allows constant-time access by index.

###Characteristics:
1. Indexed -> Items are stored at numeric indices starting from 0.
2. Fixed Size (mostly in low-level languages) -> But in Js and Py, dynamic.
3. Contagious Memory -> Fast Access using index.

##Common  Operations and Their Complexities.
1. Access(read) -> arr[i]
2. Update -> arr[i] = x
3.Insert at end ->   push() / append()
4.Insert at start -> unshift() / insert(0, x)
5. Delete at end -> pop()
6. Delete at start -> shift() / pop(0)
7.Search(unsorted) -> linear search
8.Search(sorted) -> binary search
